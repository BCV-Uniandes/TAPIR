# Towards Holistic Surgical Scene Understanding

We present a new experimental framework towards holistic surgical scene  understanding. First, we introduce the Phase, Step, Instrument, and Atomic Visual Action recognition (PSI-AVA) Dataset. PSI-AVA includes annotations for both long-term (Phase and Step recognition) and short-term reasoning (Instrument detection and novel Atomic Action recognition) in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy videos. Second, we present Transformers for Action, Phase, Instrument, and steps Recognition (TAPIR) as a strong baseline for surgical scene understanding. TAPIR leverages our dataset’s multi-level annotations as it benefits from the learned representation on the instrument detection task to improve its classification capacity. Our experimental results in both PSI-AVA and other publicly available databases demonstrate the adequacy of our framework to spur future research on holistic surgical scene understanding

This repository provides instructions to download the PSI-AVA dataset and run the PyTorch implementation of TAPIR, both presented in the paper Towards Holistic Surgical Scene Understanding. Oral presentation at [MICCAI,2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/).

## PSI-AVA

In this [link](http://157.253.243.19/PSI-AVA/) you will find the original Radical Prostatectomy surgical videos and annotations that compose the Phases, Steps, Instruments and Atomic Visual Actions recognition dataset. You will also find the preprocessed data we used for training TAPIR, the instrument detector predictions and the trained model weights on each task.

You will find the PSIAVA's benchmark data partition and annotations in outputs/data_annotations.

## TAPIR

### Installation

Please follow these steps to run TAPIR:

```
$ conda create --name tapir python=3.9
$ conda activate tapir
$ git clone https://github.com/BCV-Uniandes/TAPIR.git
$ cd TAPIR
$ bash requirements.sh
$ python setup.py build develop
```

Our code builds upon [Multi Scale Vision Transformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast)[1]. For more information, please refer to this work.

### Training

Download the "keyframes" folder in [PSI-AVA](http://157.253.243.19/PSI-AVA/) in the repository's folder ./outputs/PSIAVA/

 - PSI-AVA/keyframes/* ===> ./outputs/PSIAVA/keyframes/

Download the instrument features computed by deformable DETR from the folder "Def_DETR_Box_ftrs" in [PSI-AVA](http://157.253.243.19/PSI-AVA/) as follows:
 
 - PSI-AVA/def_DETR_box_ftrs/fold1/* ===> ./outputs/data_annotations/psi-ava/fold1/

 - PSI-AVA/def_DETR_box_ftrs/fold2/* ===> ./outputs/data_annotations/psi-ava/fold2/


For training TAPIR in:

```
# the Instrument detection or Atomic Action recognition task
$ bash run_examples/mvit_short_term.sh

# the Phases or Steps recognition task
$ bash run_examples/mvit_long_term.sh
```

Evaluating the models:

Download our trained models in [PSI-AVA](http://157.253.243.19/PSI-AVA/)/TAPIR_trained_models.

Add this path in the run_examples/mvit_*.sh file corresponding to the task you want to evaluate. Enable test by setting in the config **TEST.ENABLE True**
